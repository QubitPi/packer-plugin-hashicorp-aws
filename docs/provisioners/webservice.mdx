Type: `webservice`

<!--
  Include a short description about the provisioner. This is a good place
  to call out what the provisioner does, and any additional text that might
  be helpful to a user. See https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/null
-->

The `webservice` provisioner is used to install a __[JAX-RS](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=370) Jersey-Jetty__
webservice WAR file in AWS AMI image. Note that EBS volumes during build time will
[automatically be removed](https://packer.qubitpi.org/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs)

We take an opinionated webservice image, which goes without SSL, because
[backend API should site behind a proxy or gateway](https://dev.to/behalf/authentication-authorization-in-microservices-architecture-part-i-2cn0#global-authentication-api-gateway-and-authorization-per-service).
In addition, webservice executables are assumed to be in WAR format and is ready before preceding in order to simplify
Packer build process.

<!-- Provisioner Configuration Fields -->

**Required**

- `warSource` (string) - The path to a local WAR file to upload to the machine. The path can be absolute or relative. If
   it is relative, it is relative to the working directory when Packer is executed.

<!--
  Optional Configuration Fields

  Configuration options that are not required or have reasonable defaults
  should be listed under the optionals section. Defaults values should be
  noted in the description of the field
-->

**Optional**

- `homeDir` (string) - The `$Home` directory in AMI image; default to `/home/ubuntu`

<!--
  A basic example on the usage of the provisioner. Multiple examples
  can be provided to highlight various configurations.

### Example Usage

In the following example, an AWS [AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) image called
"my-webservice" is to be created and get registered into
[us-west-1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Availability)
region. The size of the image would be [micro](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) in this example and the base
image is an Ubuntu 22.04:

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    amazon = {
      version = ">= 0.0.2"
      source  = "github.com/hashicorp/amazon"
    }
    qubitpi = {
      version = ">= 0.0.50"
      source  = "github.com/QubitPi/qubitpi"
    }
  }
}

source "amazon-ebs" "qubitpi" {
  ami_name              = "my-webservice"
  force_deregister      = "true"
  force_delete_snapshot = "true"

  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  launch_block_device_mappings {
    device_name           = "/dev/sda1"
    volume_size           = 8
    volume_type           = "gp2"
    delete_on_termination = true
  }
  region = "us-west-1"
  source_ami_filter {
    filters = {
      name                = "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-*-22.04-amd64-server-*"
      root-device-type    = "ebs"
      virtualization-type = "hvm"
    }
    most_recent = true
    owners      = ["099720109477"]
  }
  ssh_username = "ubuntu"
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.amazon-ebs.qubitpi"
  ]

  provisioner "qubitpi-webservice-provisioner" {
    homeDir   = "/home/ubuntu"
    warSource = "my-webservice.war"
  }
}
```
